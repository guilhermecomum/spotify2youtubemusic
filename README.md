# spotify2youtubemusic
Tool to transfer music from a playlist on Spotify to YouTube Music

Place spotify API keys in .env. 

If brand account in use, also put ID in the same file. If not, remove the BRANDACC variable from the setup field.

For YTMusic API refer to: https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#authenticated-requests and set up a headers_auth.json file in the same directory.

Replace Spotify and YTMusic playlist IDs.

Once set up simply run the program and observe the output window as it build your new playlist.
